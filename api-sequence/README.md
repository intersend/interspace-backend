# V2 API Sequence Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive API sequence documentation for the Interspace V2 flat identity system. All sequences are based on 100% passing test scenarios and are optimized for AI understanding.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Structure

### Core Flows
1. [Authentication Flows](./1-authentication-flows.md) - All authentication strategies and scenarios
2. [Profile Management](./2-profile-management.md) - Profile lifecycle and operations
3. [Account Linking](./3-account-linking.md) - Identity graph and account connections
4. [Session Management](./4-session-management.md) - Token handling and session lifecycle
5. [Privacy Modes](./5-privacy-modes.md) - Privacy mode implementations and effects
6. [Error Handling](./6-error-handling.md) - Error scenarios and proper responses

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

### Flat Identity Model
- **Accounts** are primary entities (email, wallet, social, guest)
- **Profiles** are linked to accounts via ProfileAccount junction
- **Sessions** are account-based with privacy modes
- **Identity Graph** connects accounts with privacy boundaries

### Privacy Modes
- **linked** - Full sharing across linked accounts
- **partial** - Selective data sharing
- **isolated** - No sharing, independent session

### Automatic Behaviors
- First-time users get "My Smartprofile" automatically
- Profiles have development wallets by default
- Last profile cannot be deleted
- Accounts are verified based on auth method

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Examples

### New User Email Authentication
```
1. POST /api/v2/auth/send-email-code
2. POST /api/v2/auth/authenticate (strategy: email)
   â†’ Creates account
   â†’ Creates "My Smartprofile" 
   â†’ Returns tokens
```

### Returning User with Account Linking
```
1. Authenticate with existing account
2. POST /api/v2/auth/link-accounts
   â†’ Links new auth method
   â†’ Shares profiles based on privacy mode
```

## ðŸ“Š State Management

Each API call results in specific state changes:
- Database records created/updated
- Session tokens generated
- Identity graph modifications
- Audit logs recorded

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

All flows include:
- Rate limiting (V2-specific)
- Token blacklisting on logout
- Audit logging for security events
- Verification requirements per auth type

## ðŸ¤– AI Usage Guide

When using these sequences:
1. Follow exact endpoint paths and methods
2. Include all required headers (especially Authorization)
3. Respect privacy mode boundaries
4. Handle all documented error cases
5. Maintain session state between calls
