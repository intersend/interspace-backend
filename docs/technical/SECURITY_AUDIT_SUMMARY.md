## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Role-based access control
3. **Secure by Default**: Production configs are secure
4. **Fail Securely**: Errors don't leak information
5. **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging
6. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: At rest and in transit
7. **Validate All Input**: Multiple validation layers
8. **Use Security Headers**: Comprehensive header protection

## üìà Security Metrics to Monitor

1. **Authentication**
   - Failed login attempts per hour
   - 2FA verification failures
   - Account lockout frequency

2. **Authorization**
   - Permission denied events
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Profile access violations

3. **System Health**
   - Rate limit violations
   - Audit log integrity failures
   - Encryption/decryption errors

4. **Threats**
   - SIWE replay attempts
   - Suspicious activity patterns
   - Brute force attempts

## üö® Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Monitor audit logs and security events
2. **Containment**: Rate limiting and IP blocking
3. **Investigation**: Audit trail analysis
4. **Remediation**: Patch vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore from secure state
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures
