## ‚ö†Ô∏è Action Required Before TestFlight

### 1. Backend Deployment
- [ ] Set production environment variables:
  ```
  NODE_ENV=production
  EMAIL_SERVICE=sendgrid
  SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your-actual-key>
  DATABASE_URL=<production-database-url>
  FRONTEND_URL=<production-frontend-url>
  ```
- [ ] Run database migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure production CORS origins

### 2. iOS App Configuration
- [ ] Update production API URL in:
  - `BuildConfiguration.xcconfig`
  - `Environment.swift`
- [ ] Set actual credentials in `BuildConfiguration.xcconfig`:
  - Google OAuth Client IDs
  - Infura API Key
  - WalletConnect Project ID
- [ ] Increment version and build numbers
- [ ] Archive with Release configuration

### 3. Google Cloud Services
- [ ] Verify OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Add production bundle ID to iOS OAuth client
- [ ] Ensure backend web client ID matches iOS configuration
- [ ] Set up proper OAuth consent screen
- [ ] Configure authorized redirect URIs

### 4. TestFlight Submission
- [ ] Create App Store Connect record
- [ ] Upload app icon and screenshots
- [ ] Write app description and keywords
- [ ] Configure TestFlight test information
- [ ] Add internal testers
- [ ] Submit for TestFlight review

## üîí Security Checklist

- [ ] All API keys removed from source code
- [ ] Production database has strong passwords
- [ ] SSL/TLS properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] No development endpoints exposed
- [ ] Logging doesn't expose sensitive data

## üìä Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Uptime monitoring
- [ ] Database performance tracking
- [ ] API response time tracking
- [ ] Email delivery success rates

## üöÄ Launch Day Checklist

1. **Backend**
   - [ ] All environment variables set
   - [ ] Database migrations complete
   - [ ] Health check endpoints responding
   - [ ] Email sending verified
   - [ ] Authentication flow tested

2. **iOS App**
   - [ ] TestFlight build approved
   - [ ] Internal testing complete
   - [ ] Crash-free rate acceptable
   - [ ] Performance metrics good
   - [ ] User feedback addressed

3. **Support**

## üìù Notes

- JWT tokens are set to 7-day expiry as requested
- SendGrid is configured but needs actual API key
- Development features are properly disabled in release builds
- Test database files are already ignored in git
- Production API endpoint needs to be updated from placeholder

## Next Steps

1. Obtain and configure production API endpoint URL
2. Set up production database
3. Configure SendGrid API key
4. Complete Google Cloud OAuth setup
5. Prepare for TestFlight submission
